## Budget

First you have to chose a budget for your setup. Simply put, the more you pay, the better PC you get.

A good starting budget is $1200 (AUD). For that price, you can get an entry level gaming PC that can play most games relativly well. PCs will gradually get better until you hit the $5000 dollar mark, where you are getting pretty much the best of the best. 

My PC costed $1100, but that was before the [chip shortage](https://www.pcmag.com/news/inside-the-gpu-shortage-why-you-still-cant-buy-a-graphics-card) that has made everything more expensive. Thankfully, [the Ethereum Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) has caused most miners to sell their high end GPUs, and since miners aren't buying as many GPUs scalpers arent scalping as many, so all GPU pricers are dropping. That means soon you might actually be able to buy a recent GPU for it's MSRP (original price), or get an even cheaper one second hand from a miner.

If you do need to go much cheaper, there are options below $500, but be warned, it is risky. To get a PC that cheap you need to get second hand parts, and in this market second hand is always risky. There is a chance they are selling you completly broken parts, or parts they have worn out/not cared for. You could get performance significantly worse than the card was intended for because of this. If you do want to go the second hand route, make sure you are careful.

## Laptop, Prebuilt or Custom

Laptops are portable and easy to set up. They are also mass produced by a big company, who will usually offer great support and warrenty. They are good for someone who wants their system to "just work", as they do a lot of the hard work for you. They do have a few problems though. Laptops are infamous for higher price for lower performance compared to their desktop counterparts. While this is true, it is without mentioning that for a PC you need to buy more than the computer itself. You also need a keyboard, a mouse, a desk, a monitor and more. After you factor in the costs of those components, the price isn't that different. Laptops also are hard if not impossible to upgrade, because everything is so closely integrated and compacted to fit into a laptop.

Custom PCs are what most professional gamers use. They actually buy all the parts and build it themselves. Since you are the maufacturer, you get to chose every part of the system. You can chose the specs to be the best for your budget, you can take advantage of individual parts being on sale, and you can upgrade it when you want to for as long as you want to. Custom PCs are often cheaper than the other options as you can buy second parts. They are not a solution for everyone though. Building a PC is not an easy process, and once you install you do not have the manufacturer support you get from a laptop. 

If you want an ultra low-budget custom PC, LinusTechTips made a great video series with some very helpful suggestions. Once again, I recommend you be cautious when buying second hand parts.
