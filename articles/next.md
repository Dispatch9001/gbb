Now, you have a PC. You know the basics of gaming and have some games installed. Where do you go from now?

## Customisation

There are so many ways to customise your computer, past the basic changes like changing your wallpaper. It is not all that relevant to this website, so I will not go into great detail. A cool alternative to classic wallpapers is [Lively](https://rocksdanister.github.io/lively/) (Free) or [Wallpaper Engine](https://www.wallpaperengine.io/en) (Paid) for dynamic, live wallpapers. Another cool thing to look into is [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/), a cool desktop widget program for windows.
