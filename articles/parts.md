The next big part of PC gaming is chosing your computer. This is a highly personal decision, there is no one size fits all answer. 

## Operating System

For operating systems, you need to chose from Windows, Mac OS or Linux. 

Most people you should definatly go with Windows. Windows has been the industry standard for decades, and most if not all games are made with Windows as the target. It has the greatest hardware support, and the largest userbase. It has likely been preinstalled on every desktop or laptop computer you have ever purchased (unless you bought a Mac). Windows is not perfect though, as it is unnecisarily bloated, slow, and the whole OS is practically an ad for Microsoft Edge and Microsoft 365. 

I do not recommend Mac OS for gaming to anyone. Apple is actively avoiding making Mac OS a gaming platform. Due to Mac OS's lack of Vulkan (The graphics engine behind most AAA games) support, many high end games will not be possible to run (despite (community efforts)[https://moltengl.com/moltenvk/]). That's without mentioning that to legally run Mac OS you need one of Apples insainly overpriced devices, and the new M1/2 chips ARM processors requiring x86 emulation (with a significant performance loss) to play any games that have not been ported yet.

The third choice is Linux. I personally run Linux on my devices, but unless you are willing to spend a lot of time learning the system, Linux is not for you. Linux is a free and open source base for an operating system, so you have to chose a Linux-based operating system (called a distro) appropriete for you're needs.
