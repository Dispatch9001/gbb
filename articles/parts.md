The next big part of PC gaming is chosing your computer. This is a highly personal decision, there is no one size fits all answer. 

## Operating System

For operating systems, you need to chose from Windows, Mac OS or Linux. 

Most people you should definatly go with Windows. Windows has been the industry standard for decades, and most if not all games are made with Windows as the target. It has the greatest hardware support, and the largest userbase. It has likely been preinstalled on every desktop or laptop computer you have ever purchased (unless you bought a Mac). Windows is not perfect though, as it is unnecisarily bloated, slow, and the whole OS is practically an ad for Microsoft Edge and Microsoft 365. 

I do not recommend Mac OS for gaming to anyone. Apple is actively avoiding making Mac OS a gaming platform. Due to Mac OS's lack of Vulkan (The graphics engine behind most AAA games) support, many high end games will not be possible to run (despite [community efforts](https://moltengl.com/moltenvk/). That's without mentioning that to legally run Mac OS you need one of Apples insainly overpriced devices, and the new M1/2 chips ARM processors requiring x86 emulation (with a significant performance loss) to play any games that have not been ported yet.

The third choice is Linux. I personally run Linux on my devices, and I love it. For most people - unless you are willing to spend a lot of time learning the system - Linux is not the right choice. 

Think of Linux as a base for an operating system, as in you don't run it alone. You need to chose a Linux-based operating system (called a distro) to run it. There are hundreds of distros, and all of them have targeted use cases. Linux does have many advantages over the competion, as it is FOSS (Free and Open Source Software), powerful, unrestricted, considerably more performant, and infinitly more customisable than the alternatives. Linux gaming is not perfect yet though, it will require a lot of troubleshooting, learning and general time from anyone willing to try it.

Keep in mind these negatives are rapidly changing, as Valve (the company behind steam) is activly making more games run on Linux with less user effort for their Steam Deck (a portable console running Linux, kind of like a Switch) and all those enhancments also improve general desktop Linux. 

This guide is focued on Windows, so if you are chosing one of the other OS's most of this guide will not help you. If you are chosing Mac OS, I would read [PC Gamers Mac Gaming Guide](https://www.pcgamer.com/pc-gamers-guide-to-gaming-on-a-mac/). If you want to go the Linux route, the Linux Gaming community on reddit has put together a great [wiki](https://linux-gaming.kwindu.eu/index.php?title=Getting_started_with_Linux) with all the information you need.
