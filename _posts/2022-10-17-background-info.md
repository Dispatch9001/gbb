The Great Barrier Reef is one of the seven wonders of the natural world, stretching over 300 kilometres. In fact, it is the only living thing on earth visible from space with the naked eye. It is a breeding ground for humpback whales, along with endangered species like the Dugong and the Green Sea Turtle. It has great significance to nature, as well as to the towns near it, as it generates a lot of tourism. Because of that, UNESCO listed the Great Barrier Reef as a World Heritage Site in 1981, protecting it.
