- The ACF has been protecting the Great Barrier Reef since the 1960s. They kickstarted a Royal Cmmision to save the reef from oil drilling, ran campaigns to protect the reef by law (which has worked), campaigned for it to become a World Heritage Site (which has worked), expanding the Reef Marine Park, and they are still doing more today.

- The Australian Govement has implemented the [*Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan*](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/managing-great-barrier-reef.pdf), a scheme to protect the reef.
