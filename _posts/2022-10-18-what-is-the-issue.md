In recent years, climate change has caused temperature increases. Although small, they have already had massive impacts on nature. Since the air temperature is rising, the water temperature is also rising. 

The water temperature leads to coral bleaching. Coral bleaching is caused by stress from chaging conditions. When temperature, light or nutrient levels change coral expels it's algae, making them turn completly white while being increadibly vunerable.

The reef has already had 8 mass bleaching events since 1979

Climate change has also caused increased water acidity, more severe storms and rising sea levels which all have significant impacts on the reef.
